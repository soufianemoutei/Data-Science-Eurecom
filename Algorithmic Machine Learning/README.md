# Algorithmic Machine Learning Labs

The Algorithmic Machine Learning is a course at Eurecom that offers data science projects to students to gain hands-on experience. It nicely merges the theoretical concepts students can learn in machine learning and statistical inference courses, and systems concepts taught in distributed systems course.

This course covers :

- Data cleaning
- Data analysis
- Algorithm implementation/selection
- Algorithm evaluation and validation
- Optimization and further research
